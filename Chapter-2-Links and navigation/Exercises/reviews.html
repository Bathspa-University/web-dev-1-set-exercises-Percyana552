        <p>The movie tried to potray how is a life of typical hacker would be with the unsual suspects: a migrant who is rationally sleeping till a turning point in his familiy's life pops us,
         which is generally related to finance.The usual suspects suddenly decides to awaken his sleeping cyborg and decides to be utilitarian just to end up in an existential circle also.
         it doesn't really reflect the mind of hacker but rather a mind of someone who wants to get rich and regret later.Most of the hackers fight for a cause and they wouldn't back up.
         There are scenes in the movie that depict a hacker as being someone who rushes in his decisions and is not proactive about what would happen and does not assess the current situation
          on the spot in which the movie failed to give a close-to reality snap on how a hacker react and assess a risk</p>
